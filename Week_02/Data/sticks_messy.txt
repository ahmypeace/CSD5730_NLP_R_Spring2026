Every 98 year 89769hlj Thanksgiving n@! ight O we flocked OIHJOIJ out behind : %^Dad as he KPOANL dragged the Santa suit to the road and draped it over a kind of crucifix he'd built out of metal pole in the yard. Super 352 %% Bowl week      the pole was dressed in a jersey and Rod's helmet and << > Rod had to clear it with Dad if he wanted ;! to take the helmet off. On the Fourth of July the pole was Uncle Sam, on Veteran’s Day a soldier,  on Halloween a ghost. The pole was Dad's only concession to       glee. We were allowed a single !)()_. Crayola from the box at a (& time. One Christmas Eve he shrieked at Kimmie for #@#%  wasting an apple slice. He hovered over us as we poured ketchup saying: good enough good enough good enough. Birthday parties ()(@ consisted of cupcakes, no ice cream. The first time I brought a date over she said: what's with Your dad and that pole? and I sat there blinking.We left h! +m++ mome, married,  had children of our own, found the seeds of meanness blooming also within us. Dad began dressing the pole with more >> mcomplexity and less discernible logic. He draped some kind of fur over it on Groundhog Day and lugged out a floodlight to ensure a shadow. When an earthquake struck Chile he lay the pole on its side and spray painted a rift in ++ the earth. Mom died and he dressed == _ the pole as Death and hung from the crossbar photos of Mom as a          baby. We'd stop by and find odd , M :? talismans from his youth arranged around the base: army medals, 17 theater tickets, old sweatshirts, tubes of Mom's makeup. One autumn he painted the pole bright yellow. He covered it with cotton swabs that winter for warmth and provided offspring by hammering in six crossed sticks around the yard. He ran lengths of string     between the pole and the sticks, and taped to the string letters of apology, admissions of error, pleas for understanding, all written in $  a frantic hand on index cards. He painted a sign saying < }{} LOVE and hung it from the pole and another that said FORGIVE? and then he died in the hall with the radio on and we  ?>? sold the house to a young couple who yanked out +++m | ? the pole and the sticks and #*1 left them by the road @ on garbage day.
